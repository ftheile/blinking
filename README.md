# ESP32 blinking example
This example uses a LED *component*. See https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-guides/build-system.html#example-project to get an understanding of the directory structure.

The LED component has a task to blink the LED. The application (main.c) creates three LED instances for the RGB LED on Espressif's WROVER kit (see https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/hw-reference/modules-and-boards.html#esp-wrover-kit-v4-1).
